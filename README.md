# string-manipulator-exercise-template

Write a StringManipulator class that contains a ReverseString method that takes a string as input and returns the reversed string. For example, if the input string is "hello", the method should return "olleh".

Then, write unit tests to ensure that the ReverseString method is working correctly. Your tests should cover a range of scenarios, including:

1. Testing for correct reversal of a simple string.
2. Testing for correct reversal of a longer string with multiple words.
3. Testing for correct reversal of a string with special characters.
4. Testing for correct reversal of an empty string.

Here's a sample code structure to get you started:

```
public class StringManipulator {
  public string ReverseString(string input) {
    // TODO: Implement string reversal
  }
}

[TestFixture]
public class StringManipulatorTests {
  [Test]
  public void TestReverseString() {
    // TODO: Write test for string reversal
  }
}

```

Your task is to complete the TODO comments with the appropriate code to implement the ReverseString method and write the unit tests to verify its correctness. Good luck!
